                   Yes, in our platform, users can be members of multiple teams simultaneously. 
                   This flexibility allows users to participate in various projects and contribute to different teams at the same time. 
                   However, each user must manage their responsibilities effectively to
                   ensure they can provide valuable contributions to each team they are associated with.

                  <p align ="justify">
                    The maximum number of teams a user can join is limited to 10 teams per user, including the possibility of being a coach for one of those teams. 
                    While users have the flexibility to join multiple teams, adherence to this limit ensures organizational structure and prevents overcrowding within the platform. 
                    Users should consider their capacity to actively participate and contribute meaningfully to each team before joining multiple groups.

                    virtual goods, or subscriptions directly within the app. These purchases enhance the user experience by unlocking exclusive features or accessing premium content. 
                    Users should review the pricing, terms, and payment methods associated with in-app purchases before making any transactions to ensure transparency and avoid unexpected charges.

                    accessing advanced features, premium content, or additional services. Users should review the app's pricing structure, subscription plans, and any associated fees or charges before using premium features or content. It's advisable to consider the value proposition, benefits,
